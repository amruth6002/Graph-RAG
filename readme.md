Chapter 2: Causes of Climate Change 
Greenhouse Gases 
The primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous 
oxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, creating a "greenhouse effect." This effect is essential 
for life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human 
activities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate. 
Fossil Fuels 
Burning fossil fuels for energy releases large amounts of CO2. This includes coal, oil, and 
natural gas used for electricity, heating, and transportation. The industrial revolution marked 
the beginning of a significant increase in fossil fuel consumption, which continues to rise 
today.

Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth's orbit that 
change the amount of solar energy our planet receives. During the Holocene epoch, which 
began at the end of the last ice age, human societies flourished, but the industrial era has seen 
unprecedented changes. 
Modern Observations 
Modern scientific observations indicate a rapid increase in global temperatures, sea levels, 
and extreme weather events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has 
documented these changes extensively. Ice core samples, tree rings, and ocean sediments 
provide a historical record that scientists use to understand past climate conditions and 
predict future trends. The evidence overwhelmingly shows that recent changes are primarily 
driven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases.

Answer: The main cause of climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily due to human activities.
